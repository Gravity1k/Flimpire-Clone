MovieLand is a movie search application built using React.JS. Users can input a movie title or keyword, and the app will display a list of movie cards on the screen that match the search query. It uses a ReactJS componet called MovieCard that renders an individual movie card with details such as the movie's title, release year, poster image, and type. The movie card component also includes a fallback image in case the poster image is not available. Overall, my app aims to provide a simple and intuitive movie search experience for users.
